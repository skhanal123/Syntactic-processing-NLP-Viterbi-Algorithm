## About it
Here we are trying to accomplish the following

1. Write the vanilla Viterbi algorithm for assigning POS tags (i.e. without dealing with unknown words) 
2. Solve the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques. These techniques can use any of the approaches discussed in the class - lexicon, rule-based, probabilistic etc. To implement these techniques, we have tried writing modified Viterbi algorithm.
3. Compare the tagging accuracy after making these modifications with the vanilla Viterbi algorithm.
4. List down at least three cases from the sample test file (i.e. unknown word-tag pairs) which were incorrectly tagged by the original Viterbi POS tagger and got corrected after the modifications.
